#The AFL Score (Scorboard)

A weekend project aimed to learn how to fetch and manipulate data received from API.

It is not a responsive project as the focus of the project is Reactjs(and not the CSS)

Squiggle API provides data on AFL teams, which is used to show some of the basic information about the teams.
